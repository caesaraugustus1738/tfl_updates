# TfL Twitter Updates

[ https://twitter.com/TFL_TubeUpdates](https://twitter.com/TFL_TubeUpdates)

### Intro
TfL tube update bot, accurate to five minutes. Currently hosted by AWS. I created this project to learn some basic webscraping and to gain understanding of web APIs.

### Process

1. Scrape TfL data into a dictionary of dictionaries.
1. Peform formatting on data.
1. Post the data on Twitter using the Twitter API.

### Takeaways
* API wrappers are powerful. 
>Tweepy made it very easy to interface with Twitter. I did not have to deep dive into the Twitter API documentation. I need exposure to a raw API to deepen my knowledge. Tweepy made it too easy!
* Fundamental skills learnt.
>* GIT (init, status, add, commit, push)
> *SSH (RSA key pairs)
> *AWS (create instance)
> *SCP (send files to AWS Ubuntu instance)
* One class per module.
* Devise good names for objects.


### Libraries used
* Beautiful Soup
* Tweepy
