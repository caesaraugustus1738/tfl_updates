### Summary
TfL tube updates, accurate to five minutes. Currently hosted by AWS. I created this project to learn some basic webscraping and to understand the Twitter API.

### Key takeaways
* API wrappers are powerful. Tweepy made it very easy to interface with Twitter. I did not have to deep dive into the Twitter API documentation. I need exposure to a raw API to deepen my knowledge. Tweepy made it too easy!
* Basic BASH learnt to use GIT, SSH to AWS, SCP to AWS.
* I separated each class into its own module at the suggestion of a friend. This would have saved time and simplified the process if I did this initially.
* I renamed functions and classes multiple times as I progressed. It's difficult to devise good names for objects.
* I had to revise my psuedo code as I programmed.

### Libraries used
* Beautiful Soup
* Tweepy
