### Summary
TfL tube updates, accurate to five minutes. Currently hosted by AWS. I created this project to learn some basic webscraping and to understand the Twitter API.

### Key takeaways
* API wrappers are powerful. Tweepy made it very easy to interface with Twitter. I did not have to deep dive into the Twitter API documentation. I need exposure to an API unadorned to deepen my knowledge. Tweepy made it too easy!
* Basic BASH learnt to use GIT, SSH to AWS, SCP to AWS.
* I separated each class into its own module at the suggestion of a friend. If I had started like this it would have been easier to manage.
* I renamed functions and classes multiple times as I progressed. Creating good clear names for objects is surprisingly difficult.

### Libraries used
* Beautiful Soup
* Tweepy
